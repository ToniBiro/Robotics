This the hidden Google chrome T-rex game. By pressing the up and down arrow you make the dino jump or bend. You do this in order to avoid hitting the obstacles that you are running toward, in order not to die, cactuses and birds. As time passes your speed increases making it harder to avoid getting hit.

## How to play
### Positioning
It is a 2 player game. The players will be facing one another and choose the joysticks accordingly.
### How to start the game
First, you must push the reset button in order to access the main menu. From there, the player that controls the joystick closest to the reset button must move the cursor to the ‘Start’ option from the menu and press the joystick. To make sure that both players are ready to play the second joystick must also be pushed.
### Moving the Dinos
Once the game starts each player has control over its dino. To jump the joystick must be moved upwards, to bend the joystick must be moved downwards and to launch an attack on the other player the joystick must be moved in the direction of the second player.
If the joystick is moved downwards while the dino is in the air it will hurry the fall.
### How to gain points and lives
At the beginning of the game, both players receive 5 lives. The scores increase as time passes. Every time a player hits an obstacle or an attack launched by the other player one life is lost and 10 points are taken from the score.
If a player passes 5 obstacles without being hit he will gain 1 life.
### Who wins?
The game ends when one of the players reaches 0 lives and the player with the highest score wins.
