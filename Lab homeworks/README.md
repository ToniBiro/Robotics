## Lab 2 homework - Control a RGB led using 3 potentiometers
I connected to a breadboard 3 potentiometers, a RGB led and conected each potentiometer to a color. By reading the analog input from them and mapping those values to each individual led, one can combine and create any _color nuance_.

## lab 2 version 2:
In addition, (I was having a little fun), added a button and a buzzer so that the buzzer plays the maximum value read for the light maped from 0 to 1000 only when the button is pushed. (does not work so well)

## Lab 3 homework - Build a knock detector using a passive and an active Piezo Buzzer
I attached on the breadboard the 2 Piezo Buzzers and a button. I read the input from the passive one and if a certain threshold is reached the active buzzer starts playing a tone after a 5 sec delay. It can be stopped by pushing the button.
