## Lab 2 homework - Control a RGB led using 3 potentiometers
I connected to a breadboard 3 potentiometers, a RGB led and conected each potentiometer to a color. By reading the analog input from them and mapping those values to each individual led, one can combine and create any _color nuance_.

## lab 2 version 2:
In addition, (I was having a little fun), added a button and a buzzer so that the buzzer plays the maximum value read for the light maped from 0 to 1000 only when the button is pushed. (does not work so well)

## Lab 3 homework - Build a knock detector using a passive and an active Piezo Buzzer
I attached on the breadboard the 2 Piezo Buzzers and a button. I read the input from the passive one and if a certain threshold is reached the active buzzer starts playing a tone after a 5 sec delay. It can be stopped by pushing the button.

## Lab 4 homework - Control a 4-digit 7-segment display
With the help of a joyStick we control using the x axis to increase or decrease the digit currently selected from the 4, with the y axis we choose which digit to change, and with the sw bitton we interchange between the two axis.

## Lab 5 homework - Game menu
Using a joyStick you can go through the menu: Stat (that starts the game), Settings (where you can change the level and the name of the player) and HighScore (where the highest score is stored using EEPROM).
